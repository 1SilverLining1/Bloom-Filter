							Bloom Filter
				
1. It is space-optimized data structure for checking whether an element is present in set or not. 

2. Checking for the availability of the username. 

3. Bloom Filter is probabilist data structure. Probabilist data structures are the data structure that gives probablity not the exact solution. 

4. Bloom filter can tell whether a element is not present in set with 100% correct result, but does not provide with 100% surely that a element is presnt in the set. 

5. There  are verous way of finding whether an elemnt is presnt in bloom filter not : 
	
	1. By doing linear search: 
		Time - Complexity : O(n) ; 
	
	2.Binary search : 
		if element in the set are arrainged in sorted order, then binary search can be used. 
		
		Time-complexity : o(log n )
	3.Multiple Servers.
		
6.Size of  BloomFilter is fixed, it cannot be changed. elemnts in bloom filter cannot be deleted. We can Add as many as elemnt we wish to add in bloom filter. 

7.Data Structure used for Bloom Filter : 
		Hashmap , array , Tree , LinkedList . 
	
8.Bloom Filter takes very less space as compared to other data structures. 

9.We need Bit array  of fixed size. some Hash Functions.

10.Applications : 
		
		1.Google servers use BloomFilter for detecting malaciouys websites.
		2.Its used by Medium for suggesting articles to users. 
		3. Assigning user name .		
		
11.Ways for Avoiding False Positive is by making use of large no hash functions. 

			When using multiple hash functions:
			To add a new item: generate a bitmap index with each hash function, and set all of those bits to 1.
			To check if an item is present: just check if any of the bits checked are still 0. If so, the item is definitely not present.
			
			
12.Bitmap Size
		As the number of items inserted into a bloom filter increases, so does the likelihood of a false positive. That's because over time, we'll end up setting 			most of the bits to 1, instead of 0.

		The larger the bitmap, the less likely false positives are. When using a bloom filter, it's helpful to know ahead of time roughly how many elements will 			be in your set. That way you can make the bitmap large enough to avoid a high false positive rate.
